# CoA-Projects(Interactive photo gallery)

## Introduction
This project is a photo gallery web application that showcases a collection of images with hover effects and detailed descriptions.

It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a smooth and interactive user experience.

## Features
-> Display a collection of photos in a gallery format.
-> Hover effects to show more details about each photo.
-> Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

-> You have a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
-> You have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-> (Optional) A local server setup (e.g., using VS Code Live Server extension or similar).

#Installation
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:
    <b>https://github.com/Depha56/CoA-Projects.git</b>

2.Naigate to the project directory:
     cd CoA-Projects

3.Open the project in your preferred code editor.

4.Start a local server: 
-> In VS Code you can use a live server extension provided by the visual studio code extensions and the application is up and running.

## Usage
To use the photo gallery:

1.Open the project directory in a web browser.
2.Hover over the images to see more details.
3.Enjoy browsing through the photo collection.


# CoA-Projects(Challenges)

<b>4.2 Coding Challenge 1: Array Manipulation</b>

## Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers (arr) and a target sum (target), determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

## Solution 
-> Navigate to : cd Challenges  
-> Ensure that you have node in  you computer hence run in your terminal : 
<b> node arrayMap.js </b>

-> There was trying text in code also you can use the following ones:

### Example Usage
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const target = 6;
console.log(hasSubarrayWithSum(arr, target)); // Output: true (subarray [1, 2, 3] sums to 6)

<b>4.3 Coding Challenge 2: String Transformation</b>

## Problem Statement:

Given a string (str), transform it based on the following rules:

->If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.

->If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.

->If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5, perform both operations in the order specified above (reverse first, then convert to ASCII codes).

## Solution 
-> Navigate to : cd Challenges  
-> Ensure that you have node in  you computer hence run in your terminal : 
<b> stringTransform.js </b>

-> There was trying text in code also you can use the following ones:

### Example Usage
const input = "apple"; // Length is 5 (divisible by 5)
const output = transformString(input);
console.log("Input:", input);
console.log("Output:", output); // Output: 97 112 112 108 101 (ASCII codes)
